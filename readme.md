# Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card

This is my solution to the [Blog Preview Card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS).  
It was built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The goal was to create a responsive blog preview card component with an image, title, description, and author info.
